This repository is dedicated to documenting my journey of self-learning computer science in the era of AI, in honor of the dream I had ten years ago.

## Let's start reading books
To: My confused past, the data I've seen is very messy, without a system, hoping to persist through the behavior of "filling in the GitHub green squares"

Reading books in the order of [teach_yourself_cs](https://teachyourselfcs.com/), starting from
《Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs》

## 2024-10-30
這個倉庫致力於記錄我在人工智慧時代自學計算機科學的旅程，以紀念我十年前的夢想。

## 開始看書吧
至：我迷茫的曾經，看過的資料都很雜亂，沒有系統性，希望可以藉著“填滿github綠色格子這種行爲堅持下去”

看書按照[teach_yourself_cs](https://teachyourselfcs.com/)的順序來，先從
《Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs》開始
